#  Create a connection (early bound)
This sample shows how to create a connection between an account and a contact that have matching connection roles.  
  
# How to run this sample

See [How to run samples](../../../How-to-run-samples.md) for information about how to run this sample.

## What this sample does

This sample shows how to create a connection between an account and a contact that have matching connection roles.  

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Creates a connection role for account and contact entity.
2. Creates a related connection role object type code for account and contact entity.
3. Associates the connection role with itself.


### Demonstrate

1. Creates a connection between account and contact entity. 
2. Assigns a connection role to a record.

### Clean up

1. Display an option to delete the records created in [Setup](#setup).

    The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
